# Network-Congestion-Prediction-with-XGBoost-and-Remora-Optimization
A Python-based machine learning project that predicts network congestion using XGBoost Classifier and optimizes hyperparameters with a Remora-inspired optimization technique. The results are displayed through a Tkinter GUI with performance metrics and visualization charts.
